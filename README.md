Rainy Days is an online store for those who love challenges and are outside in all kinds of weather! The website is sporty and modern, just like the jackets sold in the store.
Target group: Men and women aged 30 to 50 whose interests are: being outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, canoeing

## Project brief

You must deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief you chose in Design 1.
The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief. Certain functionality requiring JavaScript can be mimicked; for example, a login page could link across from the ‘Sign in’ button.
The HTML should be semantic, neatly formatted and valid.
The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap; we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
